SQL:

select
E.name as Employee
from Employee as E
inner join Employee as M on
E.managerId = M.id
where E.salary > M.salary;

Pandas :
import pandas as pd

def find_employees(employee: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    merged = employee.merge(
        employee,
        left_on="managerId",
        right_on="id",
        suffixes=("_emp", "_mgr")
    )

    # filter employees earning more than their managers
    result = (
        merged[merged["salary_emp"] > merged["salary_mgr"]]
        [["name_emp"]]
        .rename(columns={"name_emp": "Employee"})
        .reset_index(drop=True)
    )
